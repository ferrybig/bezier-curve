# bezier-curve

This application is an example for a render of a bezier curve.

It does this using an approximation of the curve using 1001 points. These points are rendered on screen using a script that renders 5 points every frame, and there are 30 frames every second.

You can also freely drag around any points on the screen, this allows you to play around what happens to the bezier curve.

If you need more points, you can add them using `Points.addPoint()` using your browser console.
